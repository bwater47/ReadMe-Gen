# ReadMe-Gen
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
Application that generates a README.md for the user.

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to create something that helps coders generate a README.md file for their repo.
- This project was built to help coders create a README.md file for their projects.
- This solves the problem of not knowing the process of creating a README.md.
- In this project I learned that you can use node.js to run, and test your javascript files from the CLI in VS Code.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, and Node.js. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally in your device you can open VSCode. Lastly once VSCode is running, open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), make sure the current directory (CD) is targeted at the assets folder, and type node index.js to be prompted with the questions for the README.md.

## Usage

Generating a README.md file: Use node.js inside of VS Code, make sure you are inside of the assets folder in the terminal using the CD command in the CLI of VS Code (CTRL + `), and target the index.js file when using the "node path.file" command in the terminal on VS Code. This will prompt you with questions that you will fill out. Once completed you will recieve a message in the console that tells you where the README.md file is that you have generated.
